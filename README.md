# dwnld take-hom interview

Hi! We are so glad that you've decided to take on this interview with us. Here are the steps to get started.

1. You will need Node.js and NPM. Install them if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository, and go to the directory.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run watch`

The last command will start up a server on your local port 3000. Go to it, and
you should see a placeholder page. The watch command also sets up monitoring of
any changes to the JS files in the `lib` directory. The file `lib/app.js` is the
entry point, and it has already been included in the HTML file.

Some rules for this interview:

- You're welcome to use any open source Javascript libraries.
- You're welcome to use Stack Overflow, but cite your sources.
- CSS libraries/frameworks are *NOT* allowed.
